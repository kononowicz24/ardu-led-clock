# ardu-led-clock
An arduino-based table clock supporting few modes, alarms and IR remote.

Kind of a project I've done when I was busy enough to find myself another task, just not the one I was supposed to. A 4-digit 7-segment display was salvaged from an old "power doctor" and the remote it reacts to is an old Sony car radio IR controller.
