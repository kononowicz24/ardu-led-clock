# ardu-led-clock
An arduino-based table clock supporting few modes, alarms and IR remote.

Kind of a project I've done when I was busy enough to find myself another task, just not the one I was supposed to do. A 4-digit 7-segment display was salvaged from an old "power doctor" and the remote it reacts to is an old Sony car radio IR controller.

What works: changing modes between HHMM, --SS, alternating between the two above, and setting the alarm clock.
The DS1307 I have is ahead about 5 minutes in 1 month and it needs resetting, assumingly, every day. This is still in progress ,or, better to say, would be, as soon as I have any important task I don't like doing.
